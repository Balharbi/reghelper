# reghelper 0.2.0

* `simple_slopes` now includes `print` function to include significance stars.

* `ICC` function extended to include `merMod` models (from "lme4" package).

* `beta` function extended to include `glm` models.

* `simple_slopes` function extended to include `aov`, `glm`, `lme`, and `merMod`
  models.

* `cell_means` function extended to include `aov` models.

# reghelper 0.1.0

NEW FEATURES

* `beta` function calculates standardized beta coefficients.

* `block_lm` function allows variables to be added to a series of regression
  models sequentially (similar to SPSS).

* `ICC` function calculates the intra-class correlation for a multi-level model
  (lme only at this point).

* `cell_means` function calculates the estimated means for a fitted model.

* `graph_model` function graphs interactions at +/- 1 SD (uses ggplot2 package).

* `simple_slopes` function calculates the simple effects of an interaction.

* `sig_regions` function calculate the Johnson-Neyman regions of significance
  for an interaction.
