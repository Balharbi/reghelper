# reghelper

The `reghelper` R package includes a set of functions used to automate commonly
used methods in regression analysis. This includes plotting interactions,
calculating simple slopes, calculating standardized coefficients, etc.

Version 0.1.0 has been released, but be aware that this package is still early
in the development stages, and is not yet ready for general use. Functions and
function parameters may still be subject to change.

To install the most recent stable release, use the following code:
```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jeff-hughes/reghelper")
```

If you are interested in helping out with the development process, you
can install the development branch with the following code:
```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jeff-hughes/reghelper@develop")
```

## Current progress

So far, most functions that I had originally planned to include have been
implemented for `lm` models. These functions include:

* `beta` Calculates standardized beta coefficients.
* `block_lm` Allows variables to be added to a series of regression models
sequentially (similar to SPSS).
* `ICC` Calculates the intra-class correlation for a multi-level model (lme only
at this point).
* `cell_means` Calculates the estimated means for a fitted model.
* `graph_model` Easily graph interactions at +/- 1 SD (uses ggplot2 package).
* `simple_slopes` Easily calculate the simple effects of an interaction.
* `sig_regions` Calculate the Johnson-Neyman regions of significance for an
interaction.

## Things to do

There is still much work to be done. Below is a list of areas yet to be
completed, so if you are interested in helping out, these may be good places to
start:

* At minimum, I would like to extend these functions to `aov`, `glm`, `lme`, and
`lmer` models.
* None of the documentation includes example code, which needs to be included.
* The package does include test cases, but more thorough testing needs to be
done to ensure these functions work on a variety of models.
