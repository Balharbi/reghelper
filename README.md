reghelper package
=================

The `reghelper` R package includes a set of functions used to automate commonly used methods in regression analysis. This includes plotting interactions, calculating simple slopes, calculating standardized coefficients, etc.

This package is still in the development stages, and is not ready for general use. Functions and function parameters may still be subject to change.

However, if you are interested in helping out with the development process, you can install the package in R with the following code:

``` {.R}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jeff-hughes/reghelper")
```
